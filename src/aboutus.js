                <h3>1. Who are we you may ask ? </h3>

                <p>My name is Michael Nyakonu I am the owner of Jamii Developers. My company seeks to solve current Kenyan problems using information and technology. Jamii Developers is the Umbrella we fall under and we seek to grow by developing apps that interface with each other with the aid of creating more solutions.</p>

                <br/>

                <h3>2. What is a this "Single Sign-On interface" ? </h3>

                <p>The intial development of the project did not have a particular aim. So I the owner begun by ensuring we look for a method that allows all our users to access the various products with one single sign on. That way you my awesowe user only requires to login through one portal and for each app you add or install, you don't need to sign in. </p>

                <p>My hope is that in the future we will be able to introduce more security features like MFA, Biometrics to enhance your account's security plus make it easy</p>

                <p><bold>TLDR</bold> : It works like google's sign in </p>
